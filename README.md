# Introduction

This is my total remix of The_Filter (https://github.com/nateb16/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/nateb16/THE_FILTER), following the same general principle but designed from scratch with a number of smaller and larger differences to it.

The key features, which sets "The_Filter" apart from the Nevermore are kept in place: reversing the airflow so that air is not blown directly at the weak link of the enclosure (the door) and a design for 4 blowers to improve ventillation below the heatbed, for better and faster heating of the enclosure.

The following aspects however differ from "The_Filter": 

* The blowers are fully embedded in a dampening EPDM layer. Vibration noise is a major component of fan noise, especially for blowers. This substantially reduces the transmission of vibrations into the filter body. 
* Inlet and outlet mesh of the filter module is as slim as possible with the least air resistance in mind, while containing the activated charcoal pellets (diameter: >4 mm) and featuring the needed stability. 
* The filtration cassette is from one piece and (re-)filled vertically. This enables filling with smaller air gap at the top.
* The filtration cassette is gap free, except for the outlet and the interface to the blowers, which is sealed by EPDM, to maintain the positive pressure better within the cassette.
* Like "The_Filter" the "Separator" is designed that blowers are removed with the cassette when refilling AC pellets. "The_Filter" offers the two options of either an Ali-Express magentic connector, which can be harmfull to the board however, or just long cables, possible with a regular connector. This is safer but messier and less comfortable. The "Separator" has an entirely different connector strategy, based on a modified Micro-fit 3.0 connector where the snap-lock has been removed and functionally replaced by magnets, which are only used for keeping the connector in place, not for transmitting electricity.
